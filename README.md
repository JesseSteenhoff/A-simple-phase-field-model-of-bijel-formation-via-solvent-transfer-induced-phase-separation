# A simple phase-field model for bijel formation via solvent transfer-induced phase separation
The Python scripts and associated datasets for ''Analysis of Bijel Formation Dynamics During Solvent Transfer-Induced Phase Separation using Phase-Field Simulations'' by J.M. Steenhoff

The ''Python Scripts'' directory contains the scripts for the phase-field simulations of bijel formation and model validation, in addition to the code used for pore size analysis. The datasets required for the pore size analysis, being experimental confocal images and simulation results, can be found in the ''Data'' directory. To reproduce the results of the pore size analysis, only the proper path to the input data has to be provided in the corresponding script. Apart from standard libraries (NumPy, SciPy etc), the scripts make use of the SciencePlots library (https://pypi.org/project/SciencePlots/).
