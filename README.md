# A simple phase-field model for bijel formation via solvent transfer-induced phase separation
The Python scripts and associated datasets for ''Analysis of Bijel Formation Dynamics During Solvent Transfer-Induced Phase Separation using Phase-Field Simulations'' by J.M. Steenhoff

The scripts for the presented phase-field simulations, as well as for model validation and pore size analysis, can be found in the ''Python Scripts'' directory. The ''Data'' directory contains the datasets required for reproducing the results of the pore size analysis, including confocal images and simulated morphologies of STrIPS bijels. Further instructions/information is provided in each directory.
