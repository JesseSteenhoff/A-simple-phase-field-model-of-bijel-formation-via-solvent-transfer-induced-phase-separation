# A simple phase-field model for bijel formation via solvent transfer-induced phase separation
The Python scripts and associated datasets for ''Analysis of Bijel Formation Dynamics During Solvent Transfer-Induced Phase Separation using Phase-Field Simulations'' by J.M. Steenhoff

The scripts for the presented phase-field simulations of STrIPS bijel formation, as well as for model validation and pore size analysis, can be found in the ''Python Scripts'' directory. The datasets required for reproducing the pore size analysis, being confocal images and simulated morphologies of STrIPS bijels, are included in the ''Data'' directory. Further information regarding implemntation/reproduction is provided in each directory.
