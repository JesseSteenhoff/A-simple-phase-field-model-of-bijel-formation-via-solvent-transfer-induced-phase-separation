# Python script overview 

**CahnHilliard_ModelValidation**: PF simulation used for model validation with respect to described theory. Solves Cahn-Hilliard equation with periodic boundary conditions. 


**STrIPS_PF**: PF simulation of bijel formation via STrIPS with one open boundary (top) for solvent diffusion. 

**STrIPS_PF_2Sided**: PF simulation of bijel formation via STrIPS with two open boundaries (top and bottom) for solvent diffusion. 

**PoreSizeAnalysis_SigmaC**: Script for the pore size analysis of bijel morphologies with different values of the critical IFT. 

**PoreSizeAnalysis_ExperimentalVsSimulation**: Script for the pore size analysis of both experimental (confocal) and simulated bijel morphologies.
